*** Installation ***

1. You need to have the boost library installed (and to compile date_time and program_options).
2. Go to the 'src' directory, and edit the Makefile to set the variables BOOST_HEADERS and BOOST_LIBS
   to point to the location of your boost install.
3. Run 'make all' from 'src'.
4. Run 'make test' to check that everything runs.


*** Quick overview/intro ***

* Tests: run GenPDETest
* Pricer: try running GenPDEPricer -p ../resources/Call_TR.xml -m ../resources/PDE_BS_Model_1.xml -t
